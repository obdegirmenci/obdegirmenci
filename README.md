### Hi! :framed_picture:
I mainly produce visual content through free & open source programs like **Blender, GIMP, Inkscape** and **NATRON**. I am interested in *3D modeling, visualization, animation, digital compositing, vector drawing, digital painting* and *charcoal drawing*. Of course, I share my web works here.
